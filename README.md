Sparse Matrix Operations
This Python project offers functionalities to perform arithmetic operations on sparse matrices. Sparse matrices are matrices that predominantly contain zero elements, and instead of storing all elements, only the non-zero elements and their positions are stored.

Overview
The project consists of a SparseMatrix class for representing and manipulating sparse matrices, along with a main script ('script.py') for performing matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
